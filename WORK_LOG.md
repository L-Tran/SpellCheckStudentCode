I asked Mr. Blick if this was ok, but he suggested having V1 be completely creatively thought of by me. As a result I went back to what I know and started coding a solution using binary search. I had to do a little research to refresh myself on binary search and I spent the rest of class coding it. Right now I am a bit puzzled on how I compare words alphabetically/in the order of the dictionary. |

I had trouble sorting out which words were repeated. I first started with my spellingBee code that loops through every word in the list of words. However, I realized this code was not efficient I could could just use the contains function for arraylists when adding any misspelled words in the initial adding to the words. My code works for the smaller tests but it times out for the biggest test. I have to figure out how to make my code more efficient so it does not time out. |

I found that you can turn an arraylist into an array with the toArray function instead of using a loop. This helped a little bit but was not enough to help me pass the last test. A big factor of why my code is inefficient is because it takes too much time to look up every word in the dictionary. I need to find how to get either constant look up times or less than what I have now. I overhead some people in my class talk about hashsets but I'm not sure if I should resort to them. |

I did some quick research on hashsets and found out how to use them. WOW they are very useful. However, I don't quite know how they work. It is still kind of magic to me. I commented out all of my binary search as it was to slow. I turned the dictionary into a hashSet which made the lookup times constant (so fast). I had some trouble because I had to account of duplicates again, and at first I used a hashSet because they don't have duplicates but then I ran into the problem of order. I needed them to be in order so they would pass the test so I ended up using an arraylist and a hashSet. I definitely wasted a lot memory but it was worth the efficiency in my opinion. |

I first read the handout that Mr. Blick gave out in class. I was a bit confusing but I made sense of as much of I could. Then, I started coding spell check with tries. I started by making a TrieNode class for each character then I created Trie class. The hardest part right now is figuring out the search and insert functions as I have no idea how to implement them. |

BUT IT DOESN'T. After reviewing some of the slides and papers that we got in class, it became easier to implement the insert and search functions. They ended up passing test sentence, and after adding apostrophes to a index, it worked for both Poem and Alice. HOWEVER, I spent most of my time trying to figure out why my code did not work for Rome or Bard and and came to the conclusion that it was because of other special characters, or in the other case, NUMBERS. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to add way more indexes for numbers but it does not seem efficient. I just need to find a way to keep track of other characters that are not letters of apostrophes. |

I asked Mr. Blick which symbols to account for and how I should account for them, and he told me it won't hurt to just account for all of them because it already takes so much memory. I just accounted for all the extended ascii characters and this fixed my code. |

I mostly just copied my Trie code to get started. I fixed the TSTNode class so that it had more suitable variables and functions for a TSTNode. Then I started working on the insert and search functions for the TST class. I tried modifying my Trie code to work for TSTs but it was not as easy as the node class. I got stuck on how to implement the code after deciding if each character was less, greater, or equal to the current node in the tree. |

I found out what to do for the less than or greater of the if conditions for both the insert and search functions (logically it made sense just to traverse to that node or set each node if it was null). However, I got really stuck at the end because my code would either have errors or produce the wrong misspelled words. I know this was something to do with my insert an search function, particularly under the if condition if the values were the same. I did not implement the "locking in" of each letter if they were the same correctly and I was extremely troubled it was hard to think about incrementing i in the loop, or just traversing to the next node. |
| Oct 8  | 12:45pm-1:20pm  | I had some spare time in class to work on my code and I finished it! Specifically, I fixed the implementation of the search and insert functions for the TST class. I was having trouble when the current letter in the word checked matched the current node. I took some advice from Mr. Blick that I had to not just iterate the the next letter, but I actually had to set next node to the next letter. This sounds a bit confusing, but it makes sense in context of the code. I had to make sure that i + 1 would not be out of bounds because i + 1 would later be used to get the next letter in the word. Then I would increment i and check if the node right below was null, if it was, It would set the value of that node to the next letter checked, now i (because we incremented i). This posed the most trouble for me because at first I thought that when the current character in the word equaled the letter of the node, I could just do the same as the less or greater than conditions, but after realizing that the letter had to increment to the next because it confirmed the letter before, I implemented a special case for when the letters are equal. |
