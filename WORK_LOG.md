| Sep 24 | 11:00-11:55am | I first started by researching and thinking a way other than binary search to approach the problem. I asked Mr. Blick if this was ok, but he suggusted having V1 be completely creatively thought of by me. As a result I went back to what I know and started coding a solution using binary search. I had to do a little research to refresh myself on binary search and I spent the rest of class coding it. Right now I am a bit puzzled on how I compare words alphabetically/in the order of the dictionary. |
