| Sep 24 | 11:00-11:55am |                                                                                          I first started by researching and thinking a way other than binary search to approach the problem. I asked Mr. Blick if this was ok, but he suggested having V1 be completely creatively thought of by me. As a result I went back to what I know and started coding a solution using binary search. I had to do a little research to refresh myself on binary search and I spent the rest of class coding it. Right now I am a bit puzzled on how I compare words alphabetically/in the order of the dictionary. |
| Sep 26 |  8:45-9:30am  |                                                                                 I finished my binary search. I had trouble sorting out which words were repeated. I first started with my spellingBee code that loops through every word in the list of words. However, I realized this code was not efficient I could could just use the contains function for arraylists when adding any misspelled words in the initial adding to the words. My code works for the smaller tests but it times out for the biggest test. I have to figure out how to make my code more efficient so it does not time out. |
| Sep 26 |  3:15-3:45pm  | Because I couldn't get the longest test to pass, I tried to find efficiencies for my binary search code. I found that you can turn an arraylist into an array with the toArray function instead of using a loop. This helped a little bit but was not enough to help me pass the last test. A big factor of why my code is inefficient is because it takes too much time to look up every word in the dictionary. I need to find how to get either constant look up times or less than what I have now. I overhead some people in my class talk about hashsets but I'm not sure if I should resort to them. |
