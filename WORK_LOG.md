| Sep 24 | 11:00-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                              I first started by researching and thinking a way other than binary search to approach the problem. I asked Mr. Blick if this was ok, but he suggested having V1 be completely creatively thought of by me. As a result I went back to what I know and started coding a solution using binary search. I had to do a little research to refresh myself on binary search and I spent the rest of class coding it. Right now I am a bit puzzled on how I compare words alphabetically/in the order of the dictionary. |
| Sep 26 |  8:45-9:30am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                     I finished my binary search. I had trouble sorting out which words were repeated. I first started with my spellingBee code that loops through every word in the list of words. However, I realized this code was not efficient I could could just use the contains function for arraylists when adding any misspelled words in the initial adding to the words. My code works for the smaller tests but it times out for the biggest test. I have to figure out how to make my code more efficient so it does not time out. |
| Sep 26 |  3:15-3:45pm  |                                                                                                                     Because I couldn't get the longest test to pass, I tried to find efficiencies for my binary search code. I found that you can turn an arraylist into an array with the toArray function instead of using a loop. This helped a little bit but was not enough to help me pass the last test. A big factor of why my code is inefficient is because it takes too much time to look up every word in the dictionary. I need to find how to get either constant look up times or less than what I have now. I overhead some people in my class talk about hashsets but I'm not sure if I should resort to them. |
| Sep 27 |   4:15-5pm    |                My code works! I did some quick research on hashsets and found out how to use them. WOW they are very useful. However, I don't quite know how they work. It is still kind of magic to me. I commented out all of my binary search as it was to slow. I turned the dictionary into a hashSet which made the lookup times constant (so fast). I had some trouble because I had to account of duplicates again, and at first I used a hashSet because they don't have duplicates but then I ran into the problem of order. I needed them to be in order so they would pass the test so I ended up using an arraylist and a hashSet. I definitely wasted a lot memory but it was worth the efficiency in my opinion. |
| Sep 29 |  4:30-5:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         After the theory of SpellCheck, I now understand what I have to code and how it relates to graph theory. I first read the handout that Mr. Blick gave out in class. I was a bit confusing but I made sense of as much of I could. Then, I started coding spell check with tries. I started by making a TrieNode class for each character then I created Trie class. The hardest part right now is figuring out the search and insert functions as I have no idea how to implement them. |
| Oct 5  | 9:00-11:30pm  | My code is so close to working using Tries. BUT IT DOESN'T. After reviewing some of the slides and papers that we got in class, it became easier to implement the insert and search functions. They ended up passing test sentence, and after adding apostrophes to a index, it worked for both Poem and Alice. HOWEVER, I spent most of my time trying to figure out why my code did not work for Rome or Bard and and came to the conclusion that it was because of other special characters, or in the other case, NUMBERS. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to add way more indexes for numbers but it does not seem efficient. I just need to find a way to keep track of other characters that are not letters of apostrophes. |
